To Launch the app:

cd /client-angular
Run: 'npm install'

//Start the local server for the app
from /client-angular/app:
Run: 'sudo nws -p 81'

//In another terminal window:
//Run default gulp which will launch the browser-sync on port 5000
Run: 'gulp --dev' to use the local server on port 3000 (assuming you are running it locally)

The app should have launched in a new chrome tab
